Hello. Thanks for downloading this program.
I created this one because I wanted to watch how the Newton's law of universal gravitation works in dynamic. It's more interesting than just using formulas, it shows us how it aproximately happens.
I tried to make this more real, therefore all constants are aproximation to real. I'll give you table with units below.
So, you can use that. The program use SFML library. Please, go to their website and follow the instruction there:
for linux users(preferably): https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php
for windows, macos or linux users: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

If you use linux, you can use my 'makefile' for compile and running the program. Else, use a compiler in your environment.
Using the 'make': 
enter in terminal(console) 'make app' for compiling the program;
find an execulable file in the folder and run it;
remove(delete) the last files in the folder with 'make rm' command.

There is one remark. Unfortunately, keeping comparative lengths of radii, we have two things.
Firstly, more planets can't fit to the frame because they're gone far apart(from each other).
Secondly, the sizes of planets very small relatively to the Sun. Therefore we have a circle-sun and points-planets.
I decided to make simulation for only 3 planets and the Sun, to make the same radiuses for all objects(I got from radius of the Sun).

It seems you'll like my program. Have a happy viewing.
